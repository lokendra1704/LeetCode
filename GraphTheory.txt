1.  If a graph has an eulerian walk, then the number of odd degree vertices is either 0 or 2.
    When number of odd degree vertices = 0, Start = end
    When number of odd degree vertices = 2, Start != end

2.  What is a graph?
    A Graph is an ordered pair G=(V,E) where V is a finite set of elements and E is a set of 2-subsets of V.
    Simple Graph: No loops, No multiple edges (within two vertices).
    Directed Graph: Graph where each edge has a direction associated to it.

    Order of the Graph |V| : Total number of vertices.
    Size of the Graph |E|: Total Number of Edges.
    Disconnected Graph: Where unconnected vertices(or graph) are present.

3.  Families of Graph  

    # Complete Graph
    A Complete Graph Kn on n vertices is a simple graph with an edge between every pair of vertices.
    |E| = nC2

    # Bipartite Graph
    A graph whose vertex set can be partitioned into 2 sets V1 and V2 such that every edge (uv in E) has (u in V1) and (v in V2)

    # Path
    A Path is a graph whose vertices can be arrange in a sequence
    v1,v2,v3,v4....
    such that the edge set is E = {vi,vi+1 | i=1.....n}

    # Cycle
    A Path is a graph whose vertices can be arrange in a cyclic sequence
    v1,v2,v3,v4....
    such that the edge set is E = {vi,vi+1 | i=1.....n} U {v1,vn}

4.  Connected Graph
    A graph G is connected if for every pair of distinct vertices u,v in V(G) there is a path from u to v in G.

6. Sum of Degree is twice the number of edges.
